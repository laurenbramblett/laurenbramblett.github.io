My Personal Page

I am currently a US Air Force Officer and Ph.D. student in Systems Engineering at the University of Virginia. 
I work in the [Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) Lab](https://www.bezzorobotics.com/) and [Link Lab](https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab) under the advisement of Prof. Nicola Bezzo. 
Before joining the AMR Lab, I obtained my B.S. degree Applied Mathematics at the US Air Force Academy in 2017 and my M.S. degree in Operations Research at the Air Force Institute of Technology.

Within the AMR Lab, our research focuses on how to coordinate autonomous multi-agent systems (which include aerial and mobile ground vehicles).
